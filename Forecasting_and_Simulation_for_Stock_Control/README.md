# Time Series Analysis and Inventory Simulation
## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive time series exploration, modeling, and inventory simulation workflow. It is designed for businesses or analysts looking to understand demand patterns and make data-driven inventory decisions.

The workflow includes:

## Time Series Exploration & Decomposition

Decompose time series data into trend, seasonal, and noise components.

Visualize detrended data, seasonal profiles, noise, and reconstruct the original series for better understanding of underlying patterns.

## Time Series Modeling

Implement forecasting models:

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)

Double Exponential Smoothing (Holtâ€™s Linear Trend)

Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Seasonal Model)

Naive Forecasting

Evaluate models to identify the best fit for predicting future demand.

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Inventory Planning

Simulate demand and lead times to compute:

Reorder Point (ROP)

Lead Time Demand (LTD)

Safety Stock at 95% service level

Support inventory decision-making under uncertainty.

Features

Interactive visualizations of decomposition and model forecasts.

Flexible to any time series data (daily, weekly, monthly).

Provides actionable inventory insights using Monte Carlo simulations.
